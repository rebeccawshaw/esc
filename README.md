Social Application – esc
Rebecca Shaw

This design project focuses on building a social application for the iPhone to connect students during their free time. It lets other users know whenever there is a break in a friend’s schedule for a quick meet up, to grab a bite to eat, or connects with other students in your classes to form a study group. 

There will be three categories users can express availability in: eat, study, and chill. The application will also be able to specify the duration of their availability, as well as connect with the users on their friend list with the chat feature. To set a feature, the user must select one of the three options to eat, study, or chill and if no time or location is specified, the default values will be used.

The user can connect with strangers who are in their friends list with the chat feature. Simply press on their cell to open up a private connection between the two users.
