Social Application – esc
Rebecca Shaw

This design project focuses on building a social application for the iPhone to connect students during their free time. It lets other users know whenever there is a break in a friend’s schedule for a quick meet up, to grab a bite to eat, or connects with other students in your classes to form a study group. 

There will be three categories users can express availability in: eat, study, and chill. The application will also be able to specify the duration of their availability, as well as the option to private the user’s profile so that availability will be sent to only those they follow and have been added to their friends list. If the location service is turned on, the app can automatically let friends know where the user currently is, otherwise the app the will require users to specify the location they will be at so that others can locate them easily.

If the private feature has been turned off, the user can connect with strangers who have also signed up for the app. User’s will be limited to the college campus community to encourage safe meet ups.


Caption: The picture represents the three choices that the user can make: eat, study, or chill. Once the user presses one of the buttons, the duration and location of availability will need to be specified.
